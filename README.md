## Introduction

Clean air, safe water, and a stable environment are not equally distributed. The EPA Air Quality Index (AQI) by County dataset contains annual air quality metrics for every U.S. county, including counts of good, moderate, unhealthy, and hazardous days, as well as pollutant-specific exposure (CO, NO₂, Ozone, PM2.5, PM10).

As a Datathon participant, your team is challenged to explore environmental access and climate justice: Who is most exposed to pollution? Which communities face the highest long-term risk? How are environmental harms distributed across regions and populations?

This Datathon is your chance to turn real-world environmental data into actionable insights, revealing inequities, predicting future risks, and proposing solutions for a more livable planet.

## Tasks

Your task is to answer one or more of the following questions, or any other question that sparks curiosity in you and your team regarding the dataset:

### Machine Learning / Predictive Modeling

Teams interested in ML may attempt tasks such as:

- Predict **next year’s Max AQI or number of Unhealthy Days** for a county using historical data
- Predict **which counties will experience the highest pollution peaks** (Max AQI or 90th percentile AQI)
- Cluster counties based on historical air quality patterns to identify **high-risk regions**
- Model **pollutant-specific trends** to anticipate which pollutants pose the greatest long-term risk

### Data Analytics and Data Visualization

The following questions can be attempted by analytics and visualization teams:

- Which counties or states experience the **most Unhealthy or Hazardous Days**?
- How does air quality vary by **region, urbanicity, or proximity to industrial areas**?
- Compare exposure to specific pollutants (PM2.5, Ozone, NO₂) across counties
- Visualize trends over time in AQI: identify improving or worsening regions
- Identify areas at the **intersection of high pollution and vulnerable populations**
